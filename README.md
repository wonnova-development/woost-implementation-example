# Wonnova - Woost implementation example

This is an example app implementing Woost that includes the following APIs:

  - Woost Javascript API
  - Woost php SDK
  - Woost REST API

To install the needed dependencies you just have to run:

```
$ composer install
```

To run it on a web server you need to configure a virtual host for apache and name it *woost-implementation.local*.

In order to use the PHP SDK and the REST API you need to ask us for a private key.
